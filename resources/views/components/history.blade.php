                    <p>Lola Berta's Lechon is named after Lamberta Ta&ntilde;ga vda de Ramos, the grand matriarch of the Ta&ntilde;ga family in Pateros, Rizal. "Lola Berta" as she was affectionately called by everyone who knew her, would travel far and wide to the provinces and hand-select only the best.</p>
                    <p>When the pigs are brought back to the family compound in Pateros, the lechon would be cooked only as the order comes in, ensuring the utmost.</p>
                    <p>The lechon is stuffed with banana leaves and slow roasted the old fashioned way: over a pit of smoldering charcoal for consistency and quality! Today, the children, grandchild and even freat grandchild of Lola Berta continue the proud tradition of Lola Berta's Lechon. Only the best lechon can be called D' Original "Lola Berta's Lechon".</p>
